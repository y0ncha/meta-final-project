## Body

Hello Moshe,

Attached are the 12 required items for the MTA 2026 Semester B DevOps final project.

1. JSP file used: `submission/local/a-jsp-file/index.jsp`
2. GitHub screenshot showing the application/JSP: `submission/local/b-github-screenshot/github-jsp.png`
3. Tomcat screenshot with localhost URL visible: `submission/local/c-tomcat-local-screenshot/tomcat-local-url.png`
4. Public GitHub repository: `https://github.com/y0ncha/meta-final-project`
5. Monitor evidence: pending final monitor UI screenshot and final `meta-monitoring` evidence
6. Browser automation test file: `submission/local/f-browser-test-file/meta-functional.spec.js`
7. Browser automation passed-run evidence and validation explanation: `submission/local/g-browser-test-passed-run/`
8. HAR scenario description: `submission/local/h-har-scenario/scenario-description.md`
9. HAR file: `submission/local/i-har-file/meta-functional-flow.har`
10. Max-limit result and explanation: `submission/local/j-gatling-max-limit/`
11. Gatling CMD summary screenshots: stress screenshot packaged under `submission/local/k-gatling-cmd-screenshots/`; max-limit and load screenshots still pending
12. Gatling result PDFs and graph explanations: `submission/local/l-gatling-result-pdfs/`

Browser automation note: the assignment names Selenium IDE `.side`; this project uses Playwright as the Selenium IDE or similar browser automation tool, with the test file and passed-run evidence attached.

Gatling/HAR note: the HAR records the browser scenario. Gatling HAR Converter generated a reference Scala simulation, and the maintained `MetaSimulation.scala` is the cleaned HAR-derived version used for repeatable max-limit, load, and stress runs. Gatling does not load the HAR file at runtime.

Max-limit note: the current max-limit evidence is stale after the HAR-derived simulation update. Refresh before sending and report the highest virtual-user level with `KO=0` plus the first failing level, if found.

Optional public-IP bonus evidence, if submitted, is kept separately under `submission/public/` and uses:
